## 🎶 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding = **creative flow + structured exploration + civic outcomes.**  
It’s not just learning to code — it’s **designing workflows, apps, and visual reports that leaders can act on immediately.**

Over 28 days, you’ll:

* Automate workflows 💻  
* Build civic data agents with guardrails 📊  
* Deploy AI tools that respect governance + oversight 🛡  
* Visualize insights in *boardroom-ready style* 🎨  
* End with a **portfolio-ready mastery toolkit** 🚀  

---

## 🧰 Toolbox Setup

**Core Tools:**

* **Lovable** → instantly ship landing pages & simple apps  
* **Databutton** → build tiny data calculators for civic use cases  
* **Mermaid** → draw workflows, Gantt charts, and pie charts in Markdown  
* **GitHub** → track decisions & share transparent audit trails  

**Optional (technical learners):**
* **Colab** → Python notebook in the browser  
* **Ollama** → run local AI models (`llama3.1:8b`, `phi3:mini`)  
* **Flowise** → drag-drop orchestration of agents  
* **Chroma** → store & search documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

✅ **Pro Tip:** Pick one builder (Lovable *or* Replit, Databutton *or* Colab) — the goal is *momentum*, not tech overwhelm.

## 📊 Visualizations That Vibe

Leaders make decisions based on **what they can see clearly**. Your job = show the right picture fast.

* **Flowcharts** → “How does policy flow from idea → outcome?”  
* **Pie Charts** → “Where are resources going?”  
* **Gantt Charts** → “What’s the rollout timeline?”  

**Example Mermaid Diagram (Permit Backlog Flow):**

  C --> D[Approval or Rejection]
  D --> E[Public Record Updated]

## 🧠 Mini AI + Governance Glossary

| Term                                     | Beginner Friendly                             | Advanced Angle                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generative AI**                        | Makes text/images (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion) | Pretrained LLMs fine-tuned on large corpora       |
| **Agentic AI**                           | AI that “acts” (tools, memory, decisions)     | Orchestration across APIs, retrievers, governance |
| **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | AI + your docs (retrieves context → answers)  | Hybrid search + embeddings + vector stores        |
| **Context Pack**                         | Rulebook for AI (tone, scope, limits)         | Repo-linked prompts that enforce governance       |
| **Audit Trail**                          | Record of all changes                         | Git + PRs as transparent oversight logs           |

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: I’m not technical — where do I start?**
A: Use **Lovable** (for sites/apps) or **Databutton** (for calculators). Both are no-code.

**Q: My Mermaid diagram won’t render?**
A: Check that you closed the \`\`\` block. Only Mermaid syntax goes inside.

**Q: I want to make this “boardroom ready.”**
A: Use **Gantt or pie charts** → they communicate status faster than text.

**Q: What if I don’t have data?**
A: Hardcode examples (like 100 permits, 10 staff). The point is to show **proof of concept**, not perfection.

## ✅ Your First Mission

1. Pick a **domain you care about** (permits, healthcare, disaster relief, campaigns).
2. Redraw its workflow in **Mermaid** (just 4–5 boxes + arrows).
3. Save as `day0_workflow.md`.
4. 🎉 Celebrate — you’ve already built your first **boardroom-ready artifact.**

---

⚡ With this guide, both beginners and policy leaders can onboard smoothly.
By Day 14, you won’t just *learn AI tools* — you’ll **drive strategy with working prototypes and visuals.**

```
