# ⚡ Day 12 — Ship Your Personalized Site (Replit or Lovable)

## 📌 Objective
- Publish a **one-pager** with your value prop.  
- Get a **live link** you can share (optional: connect a custom domain).  
- Understand how tools like **Lovable** make shipping apps (mobile + desktop) accessible **without being a coding expert**.  
- Spark **brainstorming energy** around “what else could I ship tomorrow?”  

---

## 🛠 Steps (≤45 min)

### 🚀 Option A: Replit (classic web dev)
1. Create a new Replit (HTML/CSS/JS).  
2. Paste this minimal starter:  

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>{{your_name}} — Portfolio</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <style>
    body { font-family: system-ui; margin: 2rem; max-width: 800px; }
    .cta { padding: .8rem 1.2rem; border: 1px solid #111; border-radius: 8px; display: inline-block; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hi, I’m {{your_name}}</h1>
  <p>I build data-savvy products and AI-enabled workflows.</p>
  <a class="cta" href="mailto:{{email}}">Work with me</a>
</body>
</html>
````

3. Run → Deploy → Copy URL.

### 🌟 Option B: Lovable (AI-first shipping)

1. Log in to [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) (free account).
2. Enter a short prompt or paste your **PRD copy** (from Day 8). Example:

   > “Landing page for an Ethiopian municipal AI toolkit that helps citizens request permits faster.”
3. Lovable instantly generates:

   * A working **landing page** (mobile + desktop ready).
   * Options to export, edit text/images, or tweak design.
   * A live share link (deploy in one click).
4. Optional: attach your **custom domain** or export code for advanced editing.

💡 Lovable isn’t just for sites. You can generate:

* **Mobile apps** with basic flows (forms, dashboards, calculators).
* **Desktop tools** for quick prototypes.
* **Internal portals** (citizen services, dashboards, FAQs).

⚡ **Vibe Coding insight:** With Lovable, a **municipal leader in Ethiopia** could literally ship a citizen-facing FAQ chatbot or permit request page in the same afternoon — without hiring an engineering team.

---

### 3. Document It

* Create `Week2_Vibe_Coding/Day12/deploy_notes.md`
* Include:

  * What you shipped
  * Live link
  * Next “1% improvement” you’d make tomorrow

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* Live URL (Replit or Lovable).
* `deploy_notes.md`.
* `/logs/day12.md`.

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(day12): live personal site + notes"
```

---

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Page states a clear **who/what value**.
* [ ] Has a working CTA (email, button, or form).
* [ ] No lorem ipsum / broken links.
* [ ] Bonus: includes **AI-generated Lovable site** to demonstrate brainstorming power.

---

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 12)

1. Does your headline match the **problem in your PRD**?
2. What’s the simplest next “proof” (testimonial, citizen quote, metric)?
3. One visual polish you can add tomorrow?
4. How could this same workflow scale into a **mobile or municipal service app** with Lovable?

---

## 🎯 Role Relevance

* **Founders/CXOs:** Credible presence in 1 day.
* **Municipal Leaders:** Show citizens a working prototype (FAQ bot, service portal) today.
* **Entrepreneurs:** Land page → demo → investor link → momentum.
* **Analysts/Advisors:** Publish dashboards or toolkits as simple one-pagers.
* **Military Transition:** Translate your skills into a live portfolio instantly.

---

✨ **Day 12 Vibe:** You don’t need to be a developer. Replit gives you raw control. Lovable gives you raw speed. Both let you **ship ideas live today** — and spark tomorrow’s brainstorms.
