## 🛠 Steps (≤45–60 min)

1. **Revise PRD** outcomes & scope based on real progress.

2. **Add process map**

     U[Visitor] --> H[Portfolio Site<br/>CTA]
     H --> F[Lead Form or Email]
     F --> R[ROI Estimator<br/>Databutton]
     R --> O[Result + Call to Action]
     O --> T[Follow-up Task in Backlog]
Write demo

# Demo Script (3–5 min)
1) Problem + user (30s)
2) Show site (hero → CTA)
3) Show Databutton app (input → output)
4) How PRD + context pack guided AI coding
5) What’s next (1 concrete feature)
📂 Deliverables
Updated PRD.md

Commit: feat(day14): PRD v2 + process map + demo script

✅ Rubric (Self-Check)
 PRD reflects shipped reality (not wishful thinking)

 Process map is readable and accurate

 Demo flows logically and stays under 5 minutes

📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 14)
What did shipping teach you that the PRD missed?

Where did AI help most vs. where you needed human judgment?

What’s the one metric you’ll track next week?

🎯 Role Relevance
Execs/PMs/Analysts: You can now show strategy → working artifacts in one narrative
