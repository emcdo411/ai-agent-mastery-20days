Commit: feat(day8): PRD v1 + initial issues

✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

 Problem & users are specific

 V1 scope is realistic for this week

 Each story has acceptance criteria

 1–2 measurable outcomes named

 Risks/constraints called out

📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 8)

What’s the smallest V1 that still creates value?

Which acceptance criteria are potentially ambiguous?

Which risk could derail your week if ignored?
