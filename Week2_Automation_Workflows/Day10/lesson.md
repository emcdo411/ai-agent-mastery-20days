# 🎶 Day 10 — Vibe Coding with Make.com: *RSS → Google Sheets*

## 🌟 Vibe Objective

Spin up a **hands-off intel pipeline**: every time a blog drops or a feed updates, your Google Sheet catches it automatically like a digital net. You stay in the flow — no copy/paste, no FOMO.

⏱ Target Vibe: **≤ 30 minutes** (coffee break project)

## 🌀 Vibe Steps

### 1️⃣ Enter the Make.com Matrix

* Go to [make.com](https://www.make.com)
* Sign in (free tier is all you need to start)

### 2️⃣ Build the Scenario (Your Digital Conductor 🎼)

**Module 1: RSS → Watch RSS Feed Items**

* Drop in the feed URL that matters most to you:

  * Tech blogs if you’re an analyst
  * Market news if you’re an entrepreneur
  * Defense or healthcare feeds if you’re transitioning out of the military

**Module 2: Google Sheets → Add a Row**

* Connect your Google account
* Point it to your `Automation_Inbox` sheet
* Map your vibe fields:

  | Sheet Column | Data Flow                      |
  | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
  | `Timestamp`  | `now()`                        |
  | `Source`     | `RSS`                          |
  | `Title`      | RSS item title                 |
  | `URL`        | RSS item link                  |
  | `Notes`      | leave blank or add a quick tag |
  | `Status`     | `new`                          |
