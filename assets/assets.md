## ✅ By Now, You Can

* Explain **governance roles vs leadership actions** to stakeholders
* Use **repo-grounded RAG** to cite **file-based sources** in public-facing answers
* Ship **Lovable/Databutton micro-tools** (budget, permits, health) in hours
* Present **strategy → workflow → metrics** with clean visuals and evidence

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Mermaid

* Put **only Mermaid syntax** inside the \`\`\`mermaid code fence
* Close the fence with **three backticks** on their own line
* If you use an init/theme line, it must be the **first line** inside the block (e.g. `%%{ init: { "theme": "default" } }%%`)
* Avoid stray HTML (e.g., `<br/>`, `<code>`) inside Mermaid blocks

## 📝 Week 2 Summary Prompt (Days 6–10)

> Save as: `Week2_summary_prompt.md`

```markdown
# 📝 Week 2 Governance & Leadership Toolkit — Summary Prompt (Days 6–10)

You are an AI strategy consultant preparing a **Week 2 Governance & Leadership Report**.  
Generate a **boardroom-ready case study** summarizing outcomes from **Days 6–10**.

---

## Instructions

### 1) Cover Each Day (6 → 10)
Summarize each day for **government/municipal workflows**:
- **Day 6** — Political strategy flows: how issues become policy; where AI fits.
- **Day 7** — Context packs: enforce standards, rules, and ethics.
- **Day 8** — SDLC with governance gates: oversight & accountability.
- **Day 9** — Git without fear: audit trails & transparent collaboration.
- **Day 10** — Ship your site/app (Lovable/Replit) & micro-tools (Databutton).

### 2) Skills Checklist (What they can now do)
List actionable capabilities:
- Build political strategy **flowcharts** with AI touchpoints.
- Author **context packs** (governance, privacy, bias, terminology).
- Map **SDLC** with **governance checkpoints**.
- Use **Git** as an accountability system (clean commits, PRs, `.gitignore`).
- Ship a **Lovable/Replit** site and a **Databutton** civic data app.
- Deliver a **boardroom-ready demo** with PRD + Mermaid visuals.

### 3) Practice Routines (for mastery)
Propose a **repeatable 3-day cadence**:
- **Day A:** Redraw a municipal workflow (permits, disasters, inspections).
- **Day B:** Ship one micro-tool & publish link.
- **Day C:** Record a 3-minute demo (site + tool + governance note) and collect feedback.

### 4) Structure the Report
Use this outline:
- **Executive Summary** (1–2 paragraphs)
- **Toolkit Overview** (agents, tools, deliverables)
- **Applications for Municipalities** (Ethiopia/Caribbean examples)
- **Strengths & Limitations**
- **Next Steps** (Week 3 preview: data analysis agents; Week 4: strategic agents)

---

## Output
Produce a polished Markdown report titled:
**"Week 2 Governance & Leadership Toolkit — Vibe Coding Mastery Case Study"**
```

---

### How to use

* Replace your old Day-28 file with this **`W4D20_assets.md`**.
* Save the prompt above as **`Week2_summary_prompt.md`** next to it.
* Commit both. If Mermaid still fails to render, check that:

  * The mermaid block contains *only* Mermaid syntax
  * All code fences are properly closed
  * No HTML or stray backticks leaked into the block

---

* **Week 1:** Days **1–5**
* **Week 2:** Days **6–10**
* **Week 3:** Days **11–15**
