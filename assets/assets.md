```markdown
# üìù Week 2 Advanced Summary Prompt (Governance + Leadership Case Study)

You are an AI strategy consultant preparing a **Week 2 Governance & Leadership Report**.  
Your task is to generate a **boardroom-ready case study** summarizing the outcomes of Week 2 of the Vibe Coding Mastery Program.

---

## Instructions

### 1) Cover Each Day (8 ‚Üí 14)
Summarize each day as applied to **government/municipal workflows**:
- **Day 8** ‚Äì Political strategy flows: how issues become policy; where AI fits.  
- **Day 9** ‚Äì Context packs: enforce standards, rules, and ethics.  
- **Day 10** ‚Äì SDLC with governance gates: oversight & accountability.  
- **Day 11** ‚Äì Git without fear: audit trails & transparent collaboration.  
- **Day 12** ‚Äì Lovable/Replit: ship live sites/apps in minutes.  
- **Day 13** ‚Äì Databutton micro-tools: calculators for budgeting, permits, healthcare.  
- **Day 14** ‚Äì Mini-project: PRD v2, advanced process maps, visuals, and a demo script.

### 2) Skills Checklist (What they can now do)
List actionable capabilities, such as:
- Build political strategy **flowcharts** with AI touchpoints.  
- Author **context packs** that apply governance, privacy, and bias rules.  
- Map **SDLC** and insert **governance checkpoints**.  
- Use **Git** as an accountability system (clean commits, PRs, `.gitignore`).  
- Ship a **Lovable** (or Replit) site and a **Databutton** civic data app.  
- Deliver a **boardroom-ready demo** with PRD + visuals (Mermaid charts/Gantt).

### 3) Practice Routines (for mastery)
Propose a **repeatable 3-day cadence**:
- **Day A**: Redraw one municipal workflow (e.g., disaster response, permits).  
- **Day B**: Ship one micro-tool (e.g., budget/turnout calculator) & publish link.  
- **Day C**: Record a 3-minute demo (site + tool + oversight note) and collect feedback.

### 4) Structure the Report
Use this outline:
- **Executive Summary** (1‚Äì2 paragraphs)  
- **Toolkit Overview** (bullet list of agents, tools, and deliverables)  
- **Applications for Municipalities** (Ethiopia/Caribbean examples)  
- **Strengths & Limitations**  
- **Next Steps** (Week 3 preview: APIs, dashboards, automation)

## Output
Produce a polished **Markdown report** titled:  
**"Week 2 Governance & Leadership Toolkit ‚Äî Vibe Coding Mastery Case Study"**

### How to use

* Replace your broken file with **`W4D28_assets.md`** above.
* Save the prompt content as a **separate file**: `Week2_summary_prompt.md`.
* Commit both. If you still hit Mermaid errors, it means some prose slipped **inside** a \`\`\`mermaid block or a fence is unclosed. Copy the blocks above verbatim.
