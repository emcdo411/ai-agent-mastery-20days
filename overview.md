## 🧭 Overview

**AI Model Mastery: Microsoft SWE Track** is a *hands-on, 20-day engineering accelerator* designed for aspiring **Software Engineers preparing for roles at Microsoft, Azure AI, or other cloud-first companies**.

This project bridges *theory* and *execution* — combining Python-based model development, API integration, and cloud deployment.
It’s built with mentorship in mind, enabling mentees to gain real-world project experience while mentors track progress through structured deliverables.

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

* 🎓 **Aspiring Software Engineers** preparing for Microsoft or Azure ML engineering roles.
* 🧑🏽‍💻 **Mentored Students** seeking real deliverables to showcase in technical interviews.
* ⚙️ **Developers Transitioning** from traditional software to AI product development.
* 🧠 **Instructors & Coaches** guiding students through practical, repository-based learning.

---

## 🧩 Mentorship Mode

**Mentorship Mode** is the defining feature of this repository.
It transforms the course from an individual learning path into a *guided apprenticeship* experience that mirrors Microsoft’s learning culture.

### 💡 Mentor Responsibilities

* Review pull requests weekly and provide structured feedback using GitHub Issues.
* Challenge the mentee to defend design and model choices.
* Conduct one 30-minute mock “Design Review” during Week 3 or 4.

### 🎯 Mentee Expectations

* Commit code daily with clear commit messages.
* Submit reflections in `reflections.md` after each week.
* Document all experiments in the `/deliverables/models/` directory.

### 🧱 Mentorship Deliverables

* **Week 1:** Data pipeline walkthrough
* **Week 2:** Model performance review
* **Week 3:** API & integration test
* **Week 4:** Capstone + technical interview simulation

## 📚 Learning Structure

| Week  | Focus                              | Core Deliverable                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **1** | Data Cleaning + EDA                | Baseline regression model           |
| **2** | Model Building + Azure Integration | Trained model + evaluation notebook |
| **3** | API Integration + Plotly Dashboard | FastAPI + dashboard demo            |
| **4** | Capstone + Deployment              | Containerized AI microservice       |

Each week concludes with a checkpoint and reflection that simulates the structure of a real Microsoft sprint review.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By completing this track, learners will:

* Design and train **machine learning models** from scratch.
* Deploy AI capabilities using **FastAPI** and **Azure ML**.
* Visualize performance metrics with **Plotly Studio** dashboards.
* Practice **GitHub workflows** (commits, PRs, branches) like a Microsoft SWE.
* Document model bias, lineage, and metrics with **Model Cards**.
