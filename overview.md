* 🛠 **Local-first tools** (Colab, Flowise, Ollama, FastAPI, R)
* 📦 **10+ reusable templates & scripts**

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Walk Away With

* 📚 **Research Briefs** — citations + confidence scores, ready for exec readouts

## 🛠 How It Works (Weekly Flow)

**Week 1:** Research Foundations — briefs, citations, synthesis
**Week 2:** Automations — IFTTT / Make / Apps Script loops
**Week 3:** Data Agents — profiling, visual charts, CSV dashboards
**Week 4:** Strategy Agents — Flowise RAG, sources, refreshable memory

> Orchestrated with **PowerShell + local servers** for structure, versioning, and repeatability.

👉 This now reads like a **modern GitHub-ready README**: badges, tools, workflow call-outs, and direct tie-ins to your CSV / Flowise / RAG days.

Would you like me to also **add shields.io badges** (e.g., “Built with Flowise”, “Local-First”, “28 Days”) at the very top so it has that polished repo vibe?
