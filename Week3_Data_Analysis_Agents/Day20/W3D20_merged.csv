### Whatâ€™s inside

* Columns: `Timestamp, Source, Title, URL, Notes, Status`
* **Matches your Day 16 product URLs** so the merge can find overlaps:

  * `LP14`, `CH01`, `MN4K`, `SSD1`, `WC10`
* **One intentional duplicate URL** (`LP14`) to demonstrate dedupe
* **Four sheet-only URLs** (`ORG1`, `CABL`, `ARM1`, `HB07`) to produce right-only rows

### How to use it in Day 20

* Use this file as your **Automation\_Inbox** export (publish-as-CSV equivalent).
* Paste its link into `SHEET_CSV_URL` (or upload it directly for local testing).
* Run your merge notebook:

  * Expect `both` matches for LP14/CH01/MN4K/SSD1/WC10
  * `right_only` for ORG1/CABL/ARM1/HB07 (sheet-only)
  * Duplicate LP14 will be surfaced and can be deduped by `url`

Want a **matching GitHub Raw URL** version, or a **second sample** with a slightly different schema (e.g., `Title`, `Link`, `Label`) to demonstrate column normalization?
