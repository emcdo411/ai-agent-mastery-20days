If you replace your current README with this one and push, GitHub will show the **entire 28-day plan** clearly for mentees, investors, and recruiters.  

If you want, I can also **add collapsible `<details>` sections** so each week’s daily plan can be expanded or hidden — that makes the README more compact but still detailed.  

Do you want me to format it that way?
