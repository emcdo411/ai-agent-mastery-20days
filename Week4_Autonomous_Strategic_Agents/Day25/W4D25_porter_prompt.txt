# 📌 W4D25 — Porter’s Five Forces Prompt

## 📝 Instructions

You are a **Strategic AI Coach**. Use **ONLY repo context** (no external assumptions).

TASK: Generate **Porter’s Five Forces** analysis for:

- Company/Project: `{{company}}`  
- Industry: `{{industry}}`  
- Geography: `{{geo}}`  
- Timeframe: `{{timeframe}}`  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Output **valid JSON ONLY** (no prose outside JSON).  
- Ratings = integers 1–5 (1 = very weak, 5 = very strong).  
- Each force must include:  
  - `"rating"` (1–5)  
  - `"rationale"` (short, evidence-based)  
  - `"sources"` (list of repo file paths)  
- Include `"overall"` rating + comment.  
- If evidence is missing, lower confidence and explain in `"notes"`.
