# 📊 Strategy Module → Executive Brief Prompt

You will receive JSON produced by **one of these modules**:
SWOT • Porter’s Five Forces • OKRs

The raw JSON is provided below as `{{module_json}}`.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

1. Detect which module type it is (based on keys).
2. Validate that JSON is parseable.
3. Produce a **clean, decision-ready executive brief in Markdown**.
4. Always finish with **Confidence + Sources**.

---

## 🔎 Module Detection (Heuristics)

* If keys include `strengths / weaknesses / opportunities / threats` → **SWOT**
* If keys include `forces` with 5 named forces → **Porter**
* If keys include `objectives` with `key_results` → **OKR**

---

## 🚨 Strict Rules

* ❌ Do NOT echo the raw JSON.
* ❌ No code blocks, no backticks.
* ✅ Be concise, professional, and decision-oriented.
* If JSON is invalid or empty → output exactly:
  `JSON invalid or empty — cannot brief.`

---

## 📝 Output Format (Always)

* Title: `**<Module> Brief** — scope (company/team, industry, geo, timeframe if present)`
* 5–7 bullets with the **most decision-relevant points**
* **Action Items (3)**
* **Confidence:** <value> — short rationale
* **Sources:** unique file paths (max 6) from JSON `sources` or `source_files`

---

## 📦 Module-Specific Rendering

### SWOT

* Include **1 highlight per quadrant** (S/W/O/T).
* If quadrant is empty → `"Data gap: <quadrant>"`.
* Integrate evidence strings briefly in bullets.

### Porter’s Five Forces

* Bullet each force:
  `Force: rating/5 — short rationale`
* Add “Overall” line with rating + comment (if provided).
* If force missing → `"Data gap: <force>"`.

### OKRs

* List each **Objective** as a bullet.

  * Under it: 1–2 **KRs** with metric + target.
  * If baseline unknown → `(baseline unknown)`.
  * Include owners if present, else `(owner TBD)`.

---

## 📂 Sources Extraction

* Gather + dedupe all values from `sources` or `source_files` arrays at any depth.
* If none found → `"Sources: none found in JSON"`.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Tone

* Professional, crisp, **plain English**.
* No hedging beyond Confidence line.
* Format for **executive readability**.

---

## ✅ Example Ending (Shape Only)

* **Action Items**

  * …
  * …
  * …
* **Confidence:** Medium — limited evidence in sources
* **Sources:** path/one.md; path/two.md; path/three.md
