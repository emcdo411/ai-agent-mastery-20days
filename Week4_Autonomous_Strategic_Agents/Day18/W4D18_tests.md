## üîÑ Test 3 ‚Äî Memory Refresh with Ethiopia Data (Week 4)

**Step 1:** Type:

```
refresh memory
```

**Agent Output:**

```
Memory refresh complete. I re-indexed the repo (Markdown/CSV/TXT).
Ask your question again for updated context.
```

**Step 2:** After updating `Week4_Autonomous_Strategic_Agents/Day16/data/ethiopia_healthcare_budget.csv`, ask:

```
What changed in Ethiopia‚Äôs service delivery data since last refresh?
```

**Output (sample):**

* **New Content Detected:**

  * `ethiopia_healthcare_budget.csv` ‚Äî added 2023‚Äì2024 cost lines
  * Health allocation up \~12% vs. 2022 baseline
  * Population survey notes unchanged
* **Implication:**

  * Greater emphasis on primary care delivery lines
  * Budget broken down by district (was region)

**Action Items:**

* [ ] Validate joins to `ethiopia_population_survey.csv`
* [ ] Share updated budget insight with ministry partners
* [ ] Plan ‚Äúdelta-diff‚Äù summary (pre/post refresh) for next iteration
