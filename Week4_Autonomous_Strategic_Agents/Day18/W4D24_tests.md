## 🔄 Test 3 — Memory Refresh with Ethiopia Data

**Step 1:** Type:  
```
refresh memory
```

**Agent Output:**  
```
Memory refresh complete. I re-indexed the repo (Markdown/CSV/TXT).
Ask your question again for updated context.
```

**Step 2:** After uploading updated file `Week2_Vibe_Coding/Day13/ethiopia_healthcare_budget.csv`, ask:  
```
What changed in Ethiopia’s service delivery data since last refresh?
```

**Output (sample):**

- **New Content Detected:**  
  - `ethiopia_healthcare_budget.csv` — added with 2023–24 cost lines  
  - Health allocation increased by 12% compared to 2022 baseline  
  - Education CSV unchanged
- **Implication:**  
  - More emphasis on primary care delivery  
  - Budget lines now structured by district instead of region

**Action Items:**  
- [ ] Validate CSV joins with population survey data  
- [ ] Share updated budget insight with Ministry partners  
- [ ] Plan Day 25 “delta-diff” agent for automatic change summaries  

**Confidence:** High — CSV file diff confirmed.  
**Sources:**  
- `Week2_Vibe_Coding/Day13/ethiopia_healthcare_budget.csv`  
- `Week2_Vibe_Coding/Day13/databutton_app.md`
