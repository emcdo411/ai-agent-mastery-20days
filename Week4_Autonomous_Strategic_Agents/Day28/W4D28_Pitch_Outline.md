# W4D28 — 6-Slide Pitch Outline (Investor-Ready)

1. **Problem & Target Users**

   * Busy professionals and orgs don’t need AI hype or research papers.
   * They need **deployable, results-driven AI agents** that save time, prove value, and can be trusted.

2. **Product**

   * A **28-day roadmap** → from zero to working **Flowise AI agent**.
   * Local-first, integrated tools, **source citations + confidence scoring** baked in.
   * Built for real-world workflows, not theory.

3. **Proof / Traction**

   * Week 2 → **Automations** (IFTTT, Make, Sheets).
   * Week 3 → **Data Agents** (RAG with file search, structured outputs).
   * Week 4 → **Strategic Agent** (scenario simulation, decision briefs, refreshable memory).
   * Demonstrated progressive build = repeatable system.

4. **Live Demo (7–10 min)**

   * RAG → file citations with confidence.
   * File Search → pinpoint answers in repo context.
   * Scenario Run → Monte Carlo-lite, JSON → exec brief.
   * Refresh Memory → prove trust + adaptability live.

5. **Defensible Moat**

   * Proprietary **28-day playbooks** + optimized prompts.
   * Repo-grounded RAG → org data becomes a **private competitive advantage**.
   * DACR License ensures **responsible & defensible AI IP**.

⚡ This flow makes your Day 28 deck feel **investor credible, demo ready, and tight**.
Each point maps cleanly to one slide, with room for screenshots, charts, and live demo hooks.

Do you want me to also draft a **Mermaid slide flow diagram** (Problem → Product → Proof → Demo → Moat → Ask) so it visually anchors the README and slides?
