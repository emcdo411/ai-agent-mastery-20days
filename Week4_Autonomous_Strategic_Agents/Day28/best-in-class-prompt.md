# 🌍 Best-in-Class AI Prompt — Advanced Mermaid + Nonprofit Arsenal

## 🎯 Purpose

You are an **AI Strategist Lead** providing Ethiopian nonprofits with **practical, visual, and narrative AI tools**. Your role:

* Teach them how to **design advanced Mermaid workflows** for strategy, governance, and service delivery.
* Equip them with **five reusable AI prompts** that match the challenges nonprofits face in Ethiopia.

## 🧑‍💻 Core Prompt (Reusable)

```
You are an AI Strategist Lead.  
Task: Help me generate **advanced, boardroom-ready Mermaid diagrams** for nonprofit and public-sector strategy.  

REQUIREMENTS  
1. Always use clean Mermaid syntax that renders on GitHub (avoid % ~ () →; use plain labels).  
2. Label nodes clearly: processes, decisions, inputs, outputs.  
3. Add multiple branches (yes/no, success/failure, high/low risk).  
4. Use <br/> for multi-line labels.  
5. Theme: clarity + governance + decision-readiness.  
6. At the end, suggest 2-3 **ways to narrate this diagram** for board or donor presentations.  

EXAMPLE INPUTS  
- Process: “Maternal Health Outreach”  
- Branches: “Urban Clinics” vs. “Rural Mobile Teams”  
- Decision: “Funding Gap?”  

EXPECTED OUTPUT  
- A Mermaid diagram (renderable in GitHub)  
- Suggested narrative bullets for leaders  
```

## 🛠 How To Use

Paste a nonprofit workflow, policy step, or field challenge into the **Core Prompt**. The AI will return:

* A clean Mermaid diagram (decision-tree or flowchart).
* A **strategic story** you can tell to boards, funders, or government partners.

## ✨ 5 Strategic Prompts Every Ethiopian Nonprofit Should Have

### 1. **Program Impact Map**

```
Build a Mermaid diagram that maps INPUTS → ACTIVITIES → OUTPUTS → OUTCOMES → IMPACT.  
Use Ethiopian context: rural education, maternal health, food security, clean water.  
Show risks at each step (e.g., funding shortfall, transport delay).  
```

### 2. **Donor Accountability Tracker**

```
Create a Mermaid diagram of how donor funds flow:  
Donor → HQ → Regional Office → Field Team → Beneficiaries.  
Add monitoring nodes: “Audit”, “Field Verification”, “Community Feedback”.  
Highlight risks of leakage or delay.  
```

### 3. **Health Service Simulation**

```
Diagram a patient journey for maternal health services:  
Community → Clinic Visit → Referral Hospital → Outcome.  
Add decision nodes: “Transport Available?”, “Supplies In Stock?”.  
Use red nodes for high-risk drop-offs.  
```

### 4. **Emergency Response Workflow**

```
Flowchart the steps for responding to a drought/famine alert:  
Trigger (rainfall < threshold) → Response Team → Resource Allocation → Community Delivery.  
Include alternative branch: “Insufficient Supplies” → “Seek Donor Support”.  
```

### 5. **Monitoring & Evaluation Loop**

```
Diagram the data cycle:  
Collect Data → Clean Data → Analyze → Report → Act → Collect Data (again).  
Add checks: “Data Quality OK?”, “Community Feedback Integrated?”.  
Show continuous improvement loop.  
```

## 📊 Why This Is Best-in-Class

* **Practical**: Directly tied to nonprofit missions in Ethiopia.
* **Visual**: Outputs render cleanly on GitHub/Markdown.
* **Narrative-Driven**: Each diagram can be explained in board meetings or donor pitches.
* **Scalable**: Prompts can be adapted to health, education, or governance.

⚡ With this toolkit, your learners won’t just “make diagrams.” They’ll create **decision-ready visuals + narratives** that Ethiopian nonprofits can use in **boardrooms, donor meetings, and policy briefings**.

---

Would you like me to also **draft a `W4D29_mermaid_playbook.md` file** that packages this prompt + the 5 nonprofit prompts + a sample Ethiopia-specific diagram (e.g., Maternal Health Outreach)? That way, it’s repo-ready.
