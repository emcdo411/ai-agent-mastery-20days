# ✅ Expected Output — `W4D24_tests.md`

This file should capture the **actual results** from running the three Day 24 test prompts (Step D), formatted exactly per your Day 24 prompt policy.
Each test should follow the **Brief Answer → Action Items → Confidence → Sources** format.

---

## **Test 1:**

**Prompt:** `"What are the Week 2 deliverables and how do I validate them?"`

**Brief Answer**

* Bullet list of all Week 2 deliverables (e.g., `Day9 Workflow`, `Day10 Agent Config`).
* Each bullet explains *what it is* and *how it’s validated*, based solely on repo content.
* No fabricated details.

**Action Items**

* 2–4 clear, actionable steps (e.g., `"Run automated tests in Day10 folder"`, `"Verify flow matches exported JSON"`).

**Confidence**

* **High** — information is clearly documented in Week 2 files.

**Sources**

* `Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day9/lesson.md`
* `Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day10/config_notes.txt`
* *(Max 5 paths total)*

## **Test 2:**

**Prompt:** `"Summarize Day 21 outputs for an MBA student — bullets + actions."`

**Brief Answer**

* 3–6 bullets describing outputs in **plain business language**.
* Avoids technical jargon; focuses on relevance, outcomes, and impact.

**Action Items**

* 2–4 steps (e.g., `"Review scenario outcomes for strategic implications"`, `"Compare p05/p50/p95 ranges"`).

**Confidence**

* **Medium** — no direct business summary exists in repo; inferred from Day 21 outputs.

**Sources**

* `Week3_Data_Analysis_Agents/Day21/report.md`
* `Week3_Data_Analysis_Agents/Day21/scenario_results.json`

## **Test 3:**

**Prompt:**
`"refresh memory"` → modify a Week 2 file locally → `"What changed in Week 2’s automation since last refresh?"`

**Brief Answer**

* States the exact detected change (e.g., `"Updated Top-K from 5 to 4 in Day10 config"`).
* Confirms when memory was refreshed.
* No vague or generic responses.

**Action Items**

* 2–4 relevant follow-ups (e.g., `"Re-run validation tests"`, `"Notify stakeholders of updated config"`).

**Confidence**

* **High** — change detected and indexed during the current run.

**Sources**

* Path to the updated file (e.g., `Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day10/config_notes.txt`)

**Formatting Checklist for `W4D24_tests.md`**

* ✅ 3 clearly separated test sections
* ✅ Each follows **Brief Answer → Action Items → Confidence → Sources**
* ✅ All sources are real file paths from the repo
* ✅ No extra commentary beyond the required structure
