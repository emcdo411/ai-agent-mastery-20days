✅ Expected Output for W4D24_tests.md
This file should contain the results of running the three test prompts from Step D of your lesson, each structured exactly according to your Day 24 prompt policy.
For each test, the output should look like this (values will vary based on your repo content):

Test 1: "What are the Week 2 deliverables and how do I validate them?"
Brief Answer:

Lists each Week 2 deliverable in bullet form (e.g., Day9 Workflow, Day10 Agent Config, etc.)

Each bullet explains what it is and how it’s validated (based on repo context)

No made-up details

Action Items:

2–4 actionable steps (e.g., "Run automated tests in Day10 folder", "Verify flow matches exported JSON")

Confidence: High — clearly documented in Week 2 files.

Sources:

Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day9/lesson.md

Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day10/config_notes.txt

(max 5 paths total)

Test 2: "Summarize Day 21 outputs for an MBA student — bullets + actions."
Brief Answer:

3–6 bullets explaining what the outputs are in plain language for a business-oriented audience.

Avoids technical jargon; focuses on business relevance and outcomes.

Action Items:

2–4 bullets (e.g., "Review scenario outcomes for strategic implications", "Compare p05/p50/p95 ranges")

Confidence: Medium — no direct business summary in repo, inferred from Day 21 outputs.

Sources:

Week3_Data_Analysis_Agents/Day21/report.md

Week3_Data_Analysis_Agents/Day21/scenario_results.json

Test 3:
"refresh memory" → modify a Week 2 file locally → "What changed in Week 2’s automation since last refresh?"

Brief Answer:

Clearly states the specific change (e.g., "Updated Top-K from 5 to 4 in Day10 config").

Notes when memory was refreshed.

No generic answers — it should detect the update.

Action Items:

2–4 relevant actions (e.g., "Re-run validation tests", "Notify stakeholders of updated config")

Confidence: High — change detected in file and indexed in current run.

Sources:

Updated file’s path (e.g., Week2_Automation_Workflows/Day10/config_notes.txt)

Formatting Check for W4D24_tests.md:

3 clearly separated test sections

Each follows the Brief Answer → Action Items → Confidence → Sources structure
