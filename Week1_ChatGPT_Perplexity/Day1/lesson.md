# Day 1 — Tool Setup & First Comparison

## 📌 Objective

* Create free accounts for **ChatGPT 3.5** and **Perplexity AI**.
* Compare their strengths and weaknesses on the *same query*.
* Produce and document your **first AI research output**.
* Learn to **log, reflect, and commit** results following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

1. **Environment Setup**

   * Clone this repo (or fork if preferred).
   * Create a new branch: `day1-setup`.
   * Ensure you have a `/logs` folder for reflections.

2. **Sign Up for ChatGPT 3.5**

   * Visit [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
   * Create an account (Google/Microsoft/email).
   * Confirm you are using the **free tier (3.5)**.

3. **Sign Up for Perplexity AI**

   * Visit [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
   * Create a free account.
   * Explore the **“Focus” options**.

4. **Run the Same Query in Both**

   * Choose a neutral prompt, e.g., *“Summarize the key risks in global supply chains in 2025.”*
   * Capture both outputs.

5. **Compare Outputs**

   * Which is more factual?
   * Which is better structured?
   * Which cites sources clearly?

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* Save outputs in `Day1_comparison.md` (include query + both responses).
* Add a **reflection log** in `/logs/day1.md` (use the template below).
* Commit with message: `feat: Day 1 tool setup + comparison`.

---

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Accounts created successfully
* [ ] Comparison file saved in correct folder
* [ ] Reflection log added (1–2 sentences minimum per section)
* [ ] Git commit pushed with clear message

---

## 🎯 Role Relevance

* **Data Pros:** Establishes research workflow foundation.
* **Entrepreneurs:** Builds rapid market scanning skill.
* **Analysts:** Improves structured industry monitoring.
* **MBA/PMP:** Prepares for strategic briefings.
* **Military Transition:** Translates mission analysis into industry landscape mapping.

## 📝 Reflection Template (`/logs/reflection_template.md`)

Each daily reflection should copy this template. Fill in bullets or short paragraphs.

### Day X Reflection Prompts

1. **Tool Differences**

   * What did you notice about the *style* and *substance* of the tools you used?
   * Which would you trust more for accuracy? Why?

2. **Workflow Fit**

   * How might you use each tool in a real project (research, analysis, briefings)?
   * Where would you *not* use them?

3. **Surprises & Insights**

   * Did anything about the outputs surprise you?
   * Did the results confirm or challenge your assumptions?

4. **Next Iteration**

   * If you re-ran the test tomorrow, what would you change in your prompt or comparison method?
   * How would you log that change in your repo (commit message / note)?

---

## Example for Day 1 (`/logs/day1.md`)

**Tool Differences:** Perplexity cited sources better, ChatGPT structured its answer in cleaner paragraphs.
**Workflow Fit:** I’d use Perplexity for fact-checking, ChatGPT for drafting summaries.
**Surprises & Insights:** Perplexity’s results were shorter but more factual. I expected the opposite.
**Next Iteration:** Tomorrow I’ll try a different domain (finance) and log how the tools handle numbers vs. narrative.
