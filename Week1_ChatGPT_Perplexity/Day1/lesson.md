# ⚡ Day 1 — Tool Setup, Trust & First Comparison

## 📌 Objective

* Create free accounts for **ChatGPT 3.5** and **Perplexity AI**.
* Understand **responsible AI use** (what’s safe to paste, what’s not).
* Compare their strengths and weaknesses on the *same local query*.
* Produce and document your **first AI research output**, with a **country-specific focus**.
* Learn to **log, reflect, and commit** results following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

### 1. Environment Setup

* Clone this repo (or fork if preferred).
* Create a new branch: `day1-setup`.
* Ensure you have a `/logs` folder for reflections.

### 2. Sign Up for ChatGPT 3.5

* Visit [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).
* Create an account (Google/Microsoft/email).
* Confirm you are using the **free tier (3.5)**.
* Bookmark the site on both **desktop and mobile**.

### 3. Sign Up for Perplexity AI

* Visit [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai).
* Create a free account.
* Explore the **“Focus” options** (e.g., Academic, Web).

### 4. Responsible Use Primer

* Read `data_safety_checklist.md` in this repo.
* Quick rule: Only paste **public** or **non-sensitive** information into these tools.

  * ✅ Safe: news articles, public gov reports, local weather alerts.
  * ❌ Not safe: citizen ID numbers, patient info, private financials.

### 5. Run the Same Query in Both

* Choose a **local prompt**, e.g.:

  * *“Summarize the top challenges facing {{Country}} agriculture in 2025 using government and university sources.”*
* Capture both outputs.

### 6. Compare Outputs

* Which tool cited **local sources** (if any)?
* Which tool was clearer for a **non-technical reader**?
* Which structured the response in a way you could **reuse in a briefing**?

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* Save outputs in `Day1_comparison.md` (include query + both responses).
* Add a **reflection log** in `/logs/day1.md` (use the template below).
* Commit with message: `feat: Day 1 tool setup + local comparison`.

---

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Accounts created successfully
* [ ] Comparison file saved in correct folder
* [ ] Reflection log added (1–2 sentences minimum per section)
* [ ] Query used was **country-specific**
* [ ] Git commit pushed with clear message

---

## 🎯 Role Relevance

* **Data Pros:** Establishes local research workflow foundation.
* **Entrepreneurs:** Builds rapid market scanning skills with Caribbean/Ethiopian context.
* **Analysts:** Improves structured policy/industry monitoring.
* **MBA/PMP:** Prepares for strategic briefings with local governments.
* **Military Transition:** Translates mission analysis into country landscape mapping.

## 📝 Reflection Template (`/logs/reflection_template.md`)

### Day X Reflection Prompts

1. **Tool Differences**

   * What did you notice about the *style* and *substance* of the tools you used?
   * Which would you trust more for local accuracy? Why?

2. **Workflow Fit**

   * How might you use each tool in a real project (policy, disaster readiness, agri briefings)?
   * Where would you *not* use them?

3. **Surprises & Insights**

   * Did either tool surface a local source (gov portal, university, newspaper)?
   * Did the results confirm or challenge your assumptions?

4. **Next Iteration**

   * If you re-ran the test tomorrow, what would you change in your prompt (different sector, local language)?
   * How would you log that change in your repo?

---

## Example for Day 1 (`/logs/day1.md`)

**Tool Differences:** Perplexity cited one gov source, ChatGPT gave a smoother summary.
**Workflow Fit:** I’d use Perplexity for stats and ChatGPT for policy briefs.
**Surprises & Insights:** Perplexity missed key local agriculture data; I’ll add ministry links tomorrow.
**Next Iteration:** I’ll re-run with a hurricane-preparedness query and compare if either tool finds local disaster agency resources.

👉 Would you like me to also draft the `data_safety_checklist.md` and `country_brief_template.md` files so you can drop them right into your **Week1\_ChatGPT\_Perplexity** repo? That way Day 1 is fully self-contained.
