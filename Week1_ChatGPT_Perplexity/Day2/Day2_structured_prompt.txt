# Day 2 — Structured Prompt Engineering (RTF + PICO)

## 🧠 RTF Template

Role: You are a data scientist focused on livestock feed optimization for prime beef breeders.

Task: Identify the top 3 AI modeling approaches that can predict feed-to-yield efficiency using data on grain type, probiotic dosage, and animal weight gain.  
Include key features, sample models, and expected ROI impact.  

Format:  
1. Executive Summary (≈150 words)  
2. Markdown Table → columns: Model Approach | Input Features | Why It Works | Expected ROI Impact (%)  
3. 3 Actionable Recommendations for the breeder’s data team.

## 🧭 PICO Template

Persona: Senior ML engineer advising an agricultural analytics startup.  

Instructions:  
- Evaluate AI methods that improve feed-to-yield prediction accuracy.  
- Focus on reproducibility, interpretability, and cloud cost optimization.  
- Use examples from the livestock sector (cattle / dairy / beef).  
- If no recent regional data exists, note “Gap — Data Unavailable”.  

Context:  
Geography = United States and Brazil  
Sector = AgTech (Livestock Analytics)  
Topic = Feed Efficiency Modeling  
Year = 2025  

Output:  
1. 120–150 word executive summary  
2. Markdown table: Method | Rationale | Data Needed | Expected Lift (%) | Complexity (1–5)  
3. Bullet list of “Limitations” and “Next Steps”.
