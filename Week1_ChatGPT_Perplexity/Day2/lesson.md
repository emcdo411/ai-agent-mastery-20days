# ⚡ Day 2 — Structured Prompt Engineering (with ChatGPT-5 Upgrades)

## 📌 Objective

* Learn the **Role → Task → Format (RTF)** prompt formula.
* Create a **reusable template prompt** for **local and sector-specific use cases**.
* Compare how structured prompts perform in **ChatGPT 5** and **Perplexity AI**, with special focus on **ChatGPT-5 improvements over 3.5**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit them following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

### 1. Understand the RTF Formula

* **Role**: Define expertise, e.g.

  * *“You are a Caribbean agriculture policy advisor…”*
  * *“You are an Ethiopian health systems analyst…”*
* **Task**: Define scope, e.g.

  * *“Summarize top 3 risks for cassava exports in 2025 using government and university data.”*
  * *“Draft a patient triage checklist for rural clinics.”*
* **Format**: Specify clear outputs, e.g.

  * *“Provide results in a bilingual Markdown table (English + local language), with citations.”*

### 2. What’s New in ChatGPT-5

When testing RTF prompts in **ChatGPT-5**, note these key changes compared to 3.5:

* **Better Reasoning & Structure** — Handles complex instructions and multi-step logic with fewer errors.
* **Longer Context** — Can process and remember more input text in a single conversation (useful for longer country reports).
* **Stronger Local Awareness** — More reliable at pulling globally relevant knowledge and adapting to specific country contexts (though still double-check for source gaps).
* **Cleaner Formatting** — Markdown, tables, and structured outputs tend to require fewer corrections.
* **Faster Adjustments** — Responds better when you refine prompts iteratively (rewording, adding constraints).

### 3. Create Your First Structured Prompt

* Write a **country-specific RTF prompt**.
* Test it in **ChatGPT 5**.
* Pay attention to how **ChatGPT-5’s improvements** (above) change the quality of results compared to what you might expect from earlier versions.

### 4. Cross-Tool Comparison

* Run the same RTF prompt in **Perplexity AI**.
* Compare:

  * Which gave more **factual local data**?
  * Which had **better structure**?
  * Which produced a **clearer, ready-to-use format**?

### 5. Refine & Reuse

* Adjust your template so it can be reused across **topics (agriculture, health, disaster readiness, policy, education)**.
* Save the “final” template version in a **language-friendly format** (include placeholders for translation if needed).

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 2)

1. **Tool Differences**: Did ChatGPT-5 or Perplexity handle local references better?
2. **ChatGPT-5 vs. Older Versions**: What improvements did you notice in reasoning, formatting, or local accuracy?
3. **Workflow Fit**: Where would structured prompts like this add **real value for your country/sector**?
4. **Surprises & Insights**: Did ChatGPT-5 exceed expectations (clarity, bilingual support, structure)?
5. **Next Iteration**: How would you adjust the template (add bilingual outputs, tighter source requirements, redaction rules)?
