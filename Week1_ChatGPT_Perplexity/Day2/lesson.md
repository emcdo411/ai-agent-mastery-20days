# Day 2 — Structured Prompt Engineering

## 📌 Objective

* Learn the **Role → Task → Format (RTF)** prompt formula.
* Create a **reusable template prompt** for professional use.
* Compare how structured prompts perform in **ChatGPT 3.5** and **Perplexity AI**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit them following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

1. **Understand the RTF Formula**

   * **Role**: Define expertise (e.g., *“You are a financial analyst…”*)
   * **Task**: Define scope (e.g., *“Compare 3 companies’ quarterly earnings…”*)
   * **Format**: Specify output (e.g., *“Provide results in a Markdown table with key metrics.”*)

2. **Create Your First Structured Prompt**

   * Write a prompt using the RTF formula.
   * Test it in **ChatGPT 3.5**. Adjust wording until the output is consistent.

3. **Cross-Tool Comparison**

   * Run the same RTF prompt in **Perplexity AI**.
   * Compare clarity, factual depth, and structure.

4. **Refine & Reuse**

   * Adjust your template so it can be reused across topics (finance, healthcare, strategy, etc.).
   * Save the “final” template version.
