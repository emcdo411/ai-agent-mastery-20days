# 🧭 Day 2 Log — Structured Prompt Engineering (RTF + PICO)

**Author:** Erwin Maurice McDonald  
**Program:** AI Model Mastery — Microsoft SWE Track  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

---

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s goal was to **standardize AI prompts** using the RTF and PICO frameworks to produce consistent, testable model outputs.  
This exercise focused on:
- Translating ambiguous questions into structured templates  
- Comparing reasoning fidelity between **ChatGPT-5** and **Perplexity AI**  
- Logging measurable performance for reproducibility

## ⚙️ Environment Check
| Component | Version | Status |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Python | 3.11.x | ✅ |
| pandas | 2.x | ✅ |
| plotly | 5.x | ✅ |
| fastapi | 0.111+ | ✅ |
| pydantic | 2.x | ✅ |
| Test Setup (`python test_setup.py`) | Pass / Fail | ☐ |

## 📊 Output Scores
| Metric | ChatGPT-5 (1–5) | Perplexity AI (1–5) | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Local / Sector Data Use | | | |
| Schema Accuracy | | | |
| Readability & Tone | | | |
| Actionable Insights | | | |
| Consistency Across Reruns | | | |
| Overall Performance | | | |

## 🪶 Reflection Prompts
1. **Tool Differences:** Which model better honored the output schema and prompt contract?  
2. **Reasoning Quality:** How did ChatGPT-5’s logical steps differ from Perplexity’s retrieval emphasis?  
3. **Reusability:** Could this prompt serve as a data-labeling or synthetic dataset generator later?  
4. **Guardrails:** What additional instructions would improve trust and consistency?  
5. **Next Iteration:** What will you refine tomorrow for Day 3 (Synthetic Data Generation)?

## 🧩 Learning Takeaways
> Example: “Structured prompting reduced hallucination rates by ~30% and improved schema adherence from 3/5 to 5/5 compared to Day 1.”
