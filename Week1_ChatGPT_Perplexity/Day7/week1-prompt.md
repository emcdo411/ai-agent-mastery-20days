  3. **Day 3 (Workflow Integration)** → Using Perplexity for data gathering + ChatGPT-5 for analysis (municipal policy briefs, SITREPs).  
  4. **Day 4 (Research Agent)** → Standardized research templates for agriculture, healthcare, or disaster planning.  
  5. **Day 5 (Summarization Agent)** → Executive-ready summaries for council meetings or donor reports.   

- Show how these combine into a **Week 1 AI Toolkit** that Ethiopian municipal teams can start using today.
