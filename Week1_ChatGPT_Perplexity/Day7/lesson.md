🧰 Day 7 — Toolkit Review & Deployment (ChatGPT-5 Enhanced)
📌 Objective

Consolidate all Week 1 outputs into a reusable AI Toolkit.

Create a portfolio artifact showcasing professional mastery.

Highlight ChatGPT-5 improvements across the week and how they strengthen toolkit reliability.

Frame the toolkit for real-world use cases, e.g., Ethiopian municipalities, NGOs, or local government offices.

🛠 Steps (30–45 min)
1. Create Toolkit Folder

Add /Week1_AI_Toolkit to your repo.

2. Collect Assets

Copy all .txt prompts and .md outputs from Days 1–6.

Ensure filenames clearly reflect purpose (e.g., Day2_structured_prompt.txt, Day5_summary_agent.md).

3. Document Toolkit

Create README.md in /Week1_AI_Toolkit summarizing:

Each agent’s purpose (Comparison Agent, Structured Prompt Agent, Summarization Agent, etc.).

When to use it (research, executive briefings, FAQ, sector analysis).

Strengths / limitations (e.g., ChatGPT-5 = better reasoning/formatting; Perplexity = better citations).

Ethiopia/Caribbean examples (how local municipalities could deploy each).

4. Deploy Advanced Week Summary

Use the provided Day7_advanced_summary_prompt.md (see below).

Run it in ChatGPT-5 to produce a comprehensive Week 1 case study tailored for Ethiopian municipal leaders.

Save the generated summary as:

/Week1_AI_Toolkit/Week1_case_study.md

5. Commit & Push

Finalize folder structure and documentation.
