# Day 3 — Perplexity + ChatGPT Workflow

## 📌 Objective

* Use **Perplexity** to gather fresh, sourced data.
* Use **ChatGPT** to analyze, synthesize, and format that data.
* Learn how to combine multiple AI tools into a **single research → analysis → executive output workflow**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit them following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

1. **Gather Facts in Perplexity**

   * Choose a timely or industry-relevant query (e.g., *“What are the current risks in global semiconductor supply chains (2025)?”*).
   * Run it in **Perplexity AI** with “Focus” options enabled.
   * Export or copy the results with citations.

2. **Transfer into ChatGPT 3.5**

   * Paste Perplexity’s sourced data into ChatGPT.
   * Instruct ChatGPT to:

     * Summarize and analyze findings
     * Remove duplicate points
     * Output in a professional format (Markdown report, table, or executive summary).

3. **Compare Workflows**

   * Evaluate how each tool contributed:

     * **Perplexity** = fact-gathering with sources
     * **ChatGPT** = analysis, synthesis, and polish

4. **Refine & Save**

   * Adjust ChatGPT’s formatting prompt until the summary is boardroom-ready.
   * Save the final version as an **executive summary**.

## 📂 Deliverables

* `Day3_exec_summary.md` — polished output from ChatGPT using Perplexity data.
* `/logs/day3.md` — reflection log (using template).
* Commit with message: `feat: Day 3 combined workflow (Perplexity + ChatGPT)`.

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Query run successfully in Perplexity with sources captured
* [ ] Data transferred and refined in ChatGPT
* [ ] Executive summary saved in correct file
* [ ] Reflection log added (min. 1–2 sentences per section)
* [ ] Commit pushed with clear, descriptive message

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 3)

1. **Tool Differences**: How did Perplexity’s data differ in depth or tone from ChatGPT’s analysis?
2. **Workflow Fit**: Where could this two-step workflow save time in a real job?
3. **Surprises & Insights**: Did ChatGPT miss or misinterpret anything from Perplexity’s output?
4. **Next Iteration**: How would you refine the transfer step to ensure stronger synergy between tools?
