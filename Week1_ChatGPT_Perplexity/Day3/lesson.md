# ⚡ Day 3 — Perplexity + ChatGPT-5 Workflow

## 📌 Objective

* Use **Perplexity** to gather fresh, sourced data (preferably local/regional).
* Use **ChatGPT-5** to analyze, synthesize, translate, and format that data.
* Understand **ChatGPT-5 improvements over 3.5** in multi-source analysis.
* Combine multiple AI tools into a **single research → analysis → executive output workflow**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit them following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

### 1. Gather Facts in Perplexity

* Choose a **country-relevant query**, e.g.:

  * *“What are the top 3 climate risks for agriculture in Belize (2025)?”*
  * *“What are the healthcare staffing challenges in Ethiopia (2025)?”*
* Run it in **Perplexity AI** with “Focus” options enabled.
* Export or copy the results with citations (URLs + publication dates).

### 2. Transfer into ChatGPT-5

* Paste Perplexity’s sourced data into ChatGPT-5.
* Instruct ChatGPT-5 to:

  * Summarize and analyze findings.
  * Remove duplicate or irrelevant points.
  * Organize into a professional output (Markdown report, bilingual table, or executive summary).
  * Highlight **local gaps** (where sources were missing or weak).

⚡ **ChatGPT-5 Advantage Note**: Unlike 3.5, version 5 can:

* Handle **longer Perplexity exports** without losing structure.
* Produce **cleaner Markdown formatting** with fewer retries.
* Provide **multi-step reasoning** (e.g., categorize risks by economic, health, and social impact).
* Translate or dual-output summaries (English + local language) more consistently.

### 3. Compare Workflows

Evaluate how each tool contributed:

* **Perplexity** = fact-gathering with citations.
* **ChatGPT-5** = analysis, synthesis, translation, and polish.
* **Synergy Check**: Did ChatGPT-5 strengthen Perplexity’s data or simply repackage it?

### 4. Refine & Save

* Adjust ChatGPT-5’s instructions until the output is **boardroom-ready** (clear headings, citations, executive tone).
* Save the final version as an **executive summary**.

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 3)

1. **Tool Differences**

   * How did Perplexity’s fact-based output differ in depth or tone from ChatGPT-5’s polished analysis?

2. **ChatGPT-5 Improvements**

   * Did the longer context, stronger reasoning, or cleaner formatting make the summary better than what you’d expect from 3.5?

4. **Surprises & Insights**

   * Did ChatGPT-5 surface **missing insights** from Perplexity’s citations?
   * Did it misinterpret or over-generalize any local context?

5. **Next Iteration**

   * How would you refine the **handoff prompt** to ensure synergy (e.g., “highlight contradictions,” “produce bilingual summary”)?
