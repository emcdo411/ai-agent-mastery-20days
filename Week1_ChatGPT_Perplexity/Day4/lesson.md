# Day 4 — Building a Research Agent

## 📌 Objective

* Create a **topic-agnostic research assistant prompt** that can generate structured research outputs.
* Learn how to **standardize research tasks** for repeatable use across industries.
* Save both the **prompt template** and a **test output**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit following vibe coding discipline.

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

1. **Write Your Research Agent Prompt**

   * Use the RTF method (Role → Task → Format).
   * Example starter:

     * Role: *“You are a professional research analyst.”*
     * Task: *“Summarize the top 5 trends shaping healthcare AI in 2025.”*
     * Format: *“Provide results as a Markdown report with sections, bullet points, and citations.”*

2. **Save Prompt Template**

   * Store your final reusable research prompt in:

     * `Day4_research_agent_prompt.txt`

3. **Test the Prompt**

   * Run the prompt in **ChatGPT 3.5** or **Perplexity**.
   * For this exercise, use healthcare AI as your test topic.

4. **Save Test Output**

   * Save your AI-generated research report as:

     * `Day4_healthcare_AI.md`

5. **Commit Your Work**

   * Push both the `.txt` prompt file and `.md` output file.

## 📂 Deliverables

* `Day4_research_agent_prompt.txt` — reusable prompt template.
* `Day4_healthcare_AI.md` — AI-generated research output.
* `/logs/day4.md` — reflection log (using template).
* Commit with message: `feat: Day 4 research agent prompt + test output`.

---

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Prompt written using RTF formula
* [ ] Prompt saved as `.txt` template file
* [ ] Test output saved in correct `.md` file
* [ ] Reflection log added (1–2 sentences minimum per section)
* [ ] Commit pushed with clear, professional message

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 4)

1. **Prompt Strength**: Did the research agent respond consistently to your instructions?
2. **Workflow Fit**: How could this template support daily work in your role?
3. **Surprises & Insights**: Did the AI produce anything unexpected or missing?
4. **Next Iteration**: What would you add to make the agent more reliable (sources, formatting, constraints)?

## 🎯 Role Relevance

* **Data Pros:** Generates rapid topical briefings.
* **Entrepreneurs:** Produces quick-entry market research.
* **Analysts:** Supports competitor and sector intelligence.
* **MBA/PMP:** Speeds up case study preparation.
* **Military Transition:** Mirrors intel-style analysis workflows.
