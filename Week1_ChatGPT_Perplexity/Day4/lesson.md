# ⚡ Day 4 — Building a Research Agent (ChatGPT-5 Enhanced)

## 📌 Objective

* Create a **topic-agnostic research assistant prompt** using **ChatGPT-5**.
* Learn how to **standardize research tasks** for repeatable use across industries and local sectors.
* Understand how **ChatGPT-5 improves over 3.5** in research consistency and structure.
* Save both the **prompt template** and a **test output**.
* Log results, reflect, and commit following vibe coding discipline.

---

## 🛠 Steps (30–45 min)

### 1. Write Your Research Agent Prompt

* Use the RTF method (Role → Task → Format).
* Example starter:

  * **Role**: *“You are a professional research analyst advising Caribbean governments on agriculture diversification.”*
  * **Task**: *“Summarize the top 5 trends shaping food security in 2025, using government and university sources.”*
  * **Format**: *“Provide results as a bilingual Markdown report (English + local language), with bullet points and citations.”*

⚡ **ChatGPT-5 Advantage Note:**

* Handles **longer research prompts** with more stable structure.
* Produces **cleaner Markdown formatting** for reports.
* Can **translate or dual-output** content (e.g., English + Creole/Amharic) more consistently.
* Better at identifying **gaps in sources** than 3.5.

---

### 2. Save Prompt Template

* Store your final reusable research prompt in:

  * `Day4_research_agent_prompt.txt`

---

### 3. Test the Prompt

* Run the prompt in **ChatGPT-5**.
* For testing, you can pick:

  * **Healthcare AI** (original example).
  * **Agriculture diversification** (Caribbean context).
  * **Healthcare staffing** (Ethiopia context).
* Save the AI-generated research report.

---

### 4. Save Test Output

* Save your AI-generated research report as:

  * `Day4_research_test_output.md`
    *(rename file if using healthcare/agriculture/other topics).*

---

### 5. Commit Your Work

* Push both the `.txt` prompt file and `.md` output file.

---

## 📂 Deliverables

* `Day4_research_agent_prompt.txt` — reusable prompt template.
* `Day4_research_test_output.md` — AI-generated research output.
* `/logs/day4.md` — reflection log (using template).
* Commit with message:

  * `feat: Day 4 research agent (ChatGPT5 prompt + test output)`

---

## ✅ Rubric (Self-Check)

* [ ] Prompt written using RTF formula.
* [ ] Prompt saved as `.txt` template file.
* [ ] Test output saved in correct `.md` file.
* [ ] Reflection log added (1–2 sentences minimum per section).
* [ ] Noted how **ChatGPT-5 output differs from 3.5**.
* [ ] Commit pushed with clear, professional message.

---

## 📝 Reflection Prompts (Day 4)

1. **Prompt Strength**

   * Did ChatGPT-5 follow your RTF structure more consistently than expected?

2. **ChatGPT-5 Improvements**

   * Did you notice clearer formatting, bilingual ability, or better synthesis than 3.5?

3. **Workflow Fit**

   * How could this template support daily work (e.g., **government briefings, NGO reports, business market scans**)?

4. **Surprises & Insights**

   * Did the AI highlight **source gaps** or produce anything unexpected?

5. **Next Iteration**

   * What would you add (extra constraints, formatting rules, or local data sources)?

---

## 🎯 Role Relevance

* **Data Pros:** Generates rapid topical briefings with **cleaner outputs than 3.5**.
* **Entrepreneurs:** Produces quick-entry market research beyond tourism.
* **Analysts:** Supports **competitor and sector intelligence** in local contexts.
* **MBA/PMP:** Speeds up case study prep with **board-ready outputs**.
* **Military Transition:** Mirrors intel-style workflows while benefiting from **ChatGPT-5’s stronger reasoning**.
